Bootstrap Week-2

Questions for TA:
Column sizing questions - not understanding the context and if I need them all stated every time.
Do I need to actually link to my social media?
Do I actually need personalized text or can it just be lorem ipsum filler?


-Created the Navbar and added javascript tags within the header so that the dropdown menu would work when screen size is smaller.
-Excluded the contacts link within the navbar and instead put it in the footer.
-Made the footer sticky so it will always be on the bottom of the page.
-Chnaged various color elements to create a comfortable and consistent contrast on the website.

HOME:
-Added jumbotron dog photo as well as dogum-ipsum filler text.
-Adjusted margin within bootstraps rules.
-Adjusted bottom padding using style attribute and understanding that 1rem = 16px so that at the very smallest screen size it would not clip behind footer.

Portfolio:

-Added column configurations to make the page more responsive and keep images large and in order.
-Added a style attribute to make more room at the bottom of the page so the images wouldn't clip behind the footer.
-Also adjusted top padding so there was a nice even separation all around.


Contact:
-Fairly simple page that adjusts nicely with the changing of screen sizes.
